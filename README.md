learn_file_numpyarray is on purpose to learn numpy array.

The cifar10 (took from here https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) data is simplified by simu_data.
The classifier (took from here http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment1/) NearestNeighbor is used to test again the fake data

The test proposed is test_NearestNeighbor.py
